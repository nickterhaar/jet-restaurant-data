# jet-restaurant-data
Early Careers Coding Assignment

## The Assignment

#### The Problem
We are looking for you to find restaurant data and return this in an interface of your choice.
Using the API provided you will need to send a postcode to return a set of data, you’ll need to filter this data to focus just on the restaurant data.
You will notice that a lot of data is returned in the ‘restaurant object’ (and in the whole response!), we’re only interested in the following pieces of data being returned:
- Name
- Cuisines
- Rating - as a number
- Address

#### The Brief
We would like you to display these four data points in any way of your choosing, this could be: a web interface, console application, or anything you like.
Regardless of interface we’d like you to limit your shown data to the first 10 restaurants returned, we’re more interested in how you display each one rather than a huge list of data.

## My Solution


#### Side notes
The first 2 commits are done on the same date (and time). This is because I messed something up in the first to, so I had to redo them.
